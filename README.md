# ðŸ‘£ `footprinted` - Ruby gem to track geolocated user activity

`footprinted` is a Ruby gem that provides a simple and elegant way to track user activity with associated IP addresses and geolocation data.

Perfect for tracking profile views, downloads, login attempts, or any user interaction where location matters.

## Why

Sometimes you need to know where your users are performing certain actions from.

For example, suppose users have profiles. Where has a particular profile been viewed from?

This gem allows you to store and query the data easily:

```ruby
@user.profile_views.group(:country).count
# => { 'US'=>529, 'UK'=>291, 'CA'=>78... }
```

`footprinted` does all the heavy lifting for you, so you don't need to define any models or associations.

## How

Continuing with the user profile views example:

To track profile views in your User model, add:
```ruby
has_trackable :profile_views
```

This will automatically add a `profile_views` association to your User model, and a `track_profile_view` method.

You can then track profile views with:
```ruby
@user.track_profile_view(request.remote_ip)
```

This will store the event, along with the IP address and geolocation data associated with each profile view.

Then, as we've seen above, you can query the tracked activity with the `profile_views` association:

```ruby
user.profile_views.group(:country).count
# => { 'US'=>529, 'UK'=>291, 'CA'=>78... }
```

`footprinted` seamlessly integrates with your existing Rails models, allowing you to add multiple trackable actions with minimal setup.

## What

What `footprinted` provides is essentially a model mixin that defines a polymorphic association to store activity data associated with any model. Each of these activity datapoints includes an IP address and associated geolocation data.

This data gets stored in a table named `trackable_activities`.

For each activity, this gets stored:
- IP address
- Country
- City
- Event timestamp
- Associated record (e.g. `user`)

For your convenience, `footprinted` provides named methods that interact with the `trackable_activities` table to save and query this data (like `track_profile_view` and `profile_views`). But it could also be queried and saved by directly interacting with the `trackable_activities` relationship.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This gem depends on the [`trackdown`](https://github.com/rameerez/trackdown) gem for locating IPs.
>
> **Start by following the `trackdown` README to install and configure the gem**, and make sure you have a valid installation with a working MaxMind database before continuing â€“ otherwise we won't be able to get any geolocation data from IPs.

After [`trackdown`](https://github.com/rameerez/trackdown) has been installed and configured, add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'footprinted'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

## Setup

Run the installation generator:

```bash
rails generate footprinted:install
```

This will create:
- An initializer file at `config/initializers/footprinted.rb`
- A migration file to create the polymorphic `trackable_activities` table

Finally, run the migration:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

## Usage

Include the `Footprinted::Model` concern in your model and set what kind of activity you're tracking:
```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include Footprinted::Model
  has_trackable :profile_views
end
```

The `has_trackable :profile_views` association automatically provides you with a `track_profile_view` method that you can use:
```ruby
user = user.find(1)
user.track_profile_view(ip: '8.8.8.8')
```

You can query profile views with:
```ruby
user.profile_views
```

For example, you can get the total count of visits per country easily:
```ruby
user.profile_views.group(:country).count
# => { 'US'=>529, 'UK'=>291, 'CA'=>78... }
```

If you want to also save which user triggered the activity, you can do so with:
```ruby
user.track_profile_view(ip: '8.8.8.8', user: @user)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
