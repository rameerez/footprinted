# üë£ `footprinted` - Ruby gem to track IP-geolocated user activity

`footprinted` is a Ruby gem that provides a simple and elegant way to track user activity with associated IP addresses.

Think user profiles ‚Äì `footprinted` allows you to add `has_trackable :views` in your User model, so you can trigger `@profile.track_view(request.remote_ip)` in your controller ‚Äì to later compile stats on from where the profile has been visited.

It seamlessly integrates with your existing Rails models, allowing you to add trackable actions with minimal setup.

## Features

- üîç Easy-to-use model concern for tracking activities
- üåç IP geolocation using the [`trackdown`](https://github.com/rameerez/trackdown) gem
- üöÄ Customizable tracking associations
- üõ† Generator for easy setup and migration
- üìä Simple API for recording and querying tracked activities

## Installation

This gem depends on the [`trackdown`](https://github.com/rameerez/trackdown) gem for locating IPs. First, install `trackdown` and make sure you have a valid installation with a working MaxMind database, so we can get geolocation data from the IPs.

Then, add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'footprinted'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

## Setup

Run the installation generator:

```bash
rails generate footprinted:install
```

This will create:
- An initializer file at `config/initializers/footprinted.rb`
- A migration file to create the polymorphic `trackable_activities` table

Finally, run the migration:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Include the `Footprinted::Model` concern in your model and set what kind of activity you're tracking:
```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include Footprinted::Model
  has_trackable :profile_views
end
```

The `has_trackable :profile_views` association automatically provides you with a `track_profile_view` method you can use:
```ruby
user = user.find(1)
user.track_profile_view(ip: '8.8.8.8')
```

You can query profile views with:
```ruby
user.profile_views
```

For example, you can get the total count of visits per country easily:
```ruby
user.profile_views.group(:country).count
# => { 'US'=>529, 'UK'=>291, 'CA'=>78... }
```

If you want to also save which user triggered the activity, you can do so with:
```ruby
user.track_profile_view(ip: '8.8.8.8', user: @user)
```

## Configuration

You can configure Footprinted in the `config/initializers/footprinted.rb` file:

```ruby
Footprinted.configure do |config|
  config.ip_lookup_service = :trackdown # Default
  # Add any other configuration options here
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
